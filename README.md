Duckling Animes is a mobile app that combines the features of a social network with a cloud-based SQL database on Firebase. It was developed as a project for the LP3 discipline at SENAI CIMATEC during the first semester of 2023. Users can create accounts, like each other's anime posts, and share their top four animes. Additionally, users have the ability to delete their own anime posts. It provides a unique platform for anime enthusiasts to connect, interact, and showcase their favorite anime content.

## Resourses 🧑‍🔬:

- Cloud-based SQL database using Firebase: Enables storing and managing user data such as account information, liked animes, and posted animes.

- User account creation and login: Users can create their accounts and log in to access the app's features and personalized settings.

- Liking animes: Users can express their appreciation for other users' animes by liking them. This feature promotes engagement and interaction within the community.
